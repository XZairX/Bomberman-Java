# Recreate a Classic Arcade Game
The project I have chosen to undertake is Michael Fairbank's "Recreate a Classic Arcade Game" where I am given the freedom to recreate a classic 2D arcade game from the 80s or 90s. The challenge from this task comes from the requirement of having to code everything myself, including the engine that the game is to run on. Unity, a popular "high-powered" game engine, is explicitly forbidden unless the project has a enough high complexity to warrant its use. The classic arcade game of my choice is Bomberman, a strategic mazed-based franchise whose multiplayer components still stand strong to this very day. As I could not attain permission to use Unity despite having never used it before, I chose to use Java instead, as it is the programming language that I am most comfortable and willing to experiment with.

>A *brief* paragraph explaining your project and what it does should be written here. The idea is to give readers an overview of what it is that you've built.

## Getting Started
In order to get the project running, you will need to have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your computer. This is a Java IDE (integrated development environment) that allows for the development of computer software, and more importantly, for the viewing and manipulation of the program that this project is contained within. IntelliJ is provided by JetBrains, a certified company who specialise in distributing developer tools for professional and teams. As it is distributed as open-source software, it can be freely downloaded from JetBrain's official website without concern for malicious malware.

>You should write a bit about **how** I can get your project working, It's good to think in terms of the following sections:

### Prerequisites
* IntelliJ IDEA Version 2016 and later
* Java JDK 8 or later

>What do I need in order to get your project running? For example,

### Installing IntelliJ
* Installing IntelliJ guide
>A step by step guide on how to build and install your software, for example:

1. Navigate to the [official JetBrains official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and select the IntelliJ-based IDEs option to be redirected to the [IntelliJ-based IDE page.](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html#type=ide)

2. Select the IntelliJ IDEA option on this page to once again be redirected this time to the main [IntelliJ IDEA page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

3. Select the "DOWNLOAD" option to be further redirected to the [IntelliJ download page.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) Here, two versions are listed: Ultimate and Community. A list of features is present on this page which highlight the differences between the two editions. Also take note that there are different versions of IntelliJ for compatibility with different operating systems. The page provided is for downloading IntelliJ on Windows Operating Systems and this will need to be changed if not installing on a Windows computer. For the purposes of viewing the project, you should select the Community version which can be acquired for free.

4. Download and save the binary .exe file, run it, and follow the instructions to install the application.

### Installing Java JDK
* Downloading Java JDK

#### Install libraries and run program
* Setting up Java SDK
* Package and class files


### Versioning Statergy
Git commits
>What versioning statergy are you using for your project, something like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) might be a good idea.
