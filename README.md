# Recreate a Classic Arcade Game
The project I have chosen to undertake was Michael Fairbank's "Recreate a Classic Arcade Game" where I am given the freedom to recreate a classic 2D arcade game from the 80s or 90s. The challenge from this task comes from the requirement of having to code everything myself, including the engine that the game is to run on. Unity, a popular "high-powered" game engine is explicitly forbidden unless the project has a enough high complexity to warrant its use. The game of my choice is Bomberman, a strategic mazed-based series whose multiplayer components still stand strong to this very day. As I could not attain permission to use Unity despite having never used it before, I chose to use Java instead, as it is a programming language that I am very comfortable with.

>A *brief* paragraph explaining your project and what it does should be written here. The idea is to give readers an overview of what it is that you've built.

## Getting Started
In order to get the project running, you will need to have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your computer. This is a Java IDE (integrated development environment) that allows for the development of computer software, and more importantly, for the viewing and manipulation of the aforementioned project. As IntelliJ is distributed as open-source software, it can be freely downloaded from its official website without concern for malicious malware.

>You should write a bit about **how** I can get your project working, It's good to think in terms of the following sections:

### Prerequisites
* IntelliJ
* Java SDK

>What do I need in order to get your project running? For example,

### Installing
>A step by step guide on how to build and install your software, for example:

#### Edit the configuration file
In myconfig.ini, change the following settings to match your requirements:

```
database_name=test
database_user=test
database_pass=password
```

#### Install libraries and run program

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

### Running Tests
How do I run your tests? Make it as easy as possible to do this!

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./tests.py
```

### Versioning Statergy
What versioning statergy are you using for your project, something like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) might be a good idea.
