    z - axis for sorting painted layers
    FireObject private RECURSION_DELAY (pass through emitFire)

    - ScheduledExecutorService
    - emitFire to be compressed into a single object Thread? (no need for second constructor)
    - Lazy fix: Player limitation dropping bombs when hit())
    Look into starting to write the report
